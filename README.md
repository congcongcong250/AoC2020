# AoC2020 with scheme

This is used as a oppotunity to learn scheme. I picked MIT-scheme since it is also used by SICP, a book to be finished, tho there seems to be less support for it than its siblings (and lisp relatives).

It's gonna be a slow, since emacs. In VScode, "rainbow brackets" really helps.
